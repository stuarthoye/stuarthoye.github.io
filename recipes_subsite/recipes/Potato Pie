potato pie (tarte aux pommes de terre)

This recipe was discovered by chance in the library of
the ancient Abbaye de Saint-Amand-Montrond by an
itinerant Rothbury oblate


puff pastry (two frozen sheets save a lot of work)

old potatoes, thinly sliced, washed and dried

white onion, finely chopped
couple of cloves of garlic, crushed and chopped

salt and pepper; nutmeg

parsley, finely chopped

500 ml crème fraîche

pie dish


Roll out slightly more than half the pastry and install in dish. 

Par-cook the sliced potatoes in a little butter in a covered frying pan over a low heat, until they are just tender when tested with a small sharp knife. 
Don’t let them catch and burn!

Mix in the chopped onion and garlic and cook a little longer. Add salt, pepper, nutmeg and parsley. Spoon into the pie shell.

Roll out the top and cover the pie. Seal using a pastry brush and milk.

With a sharp knife cut a circle in the centre of the pastry top. Make a few chevron steam vents in the top.

(Optionally, if there is some pastry left you may roll it out, cut it into strips and weave a grid on the top crust.)

Place the pie in the oven at gas mark 6 (200°C, 400°F) for 45-60 minutes.
10 minutes before the end, pull out the pie, open the lid in the center of the pie, pour in the crème fraîche, and put it back into the oven so the cream will melt and spread.
