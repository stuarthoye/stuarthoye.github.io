english pancakes


This is Mam’s pancake recipe. There were five of us kids; on Pancake Tuesday at tea-time we’d line up in the kitchen, plate in hand, impatiently waiting for Mam to turn out the pancakes When we got one we’d go to the table, eat it, then run to the back of the queue. Henry Ford would have been proud of her.


6 oz (170g) plain white flour
pinch of salt
2 eggs
2 desertspoons oil (20ml)
¾ pint (400ml) milk


Sift flour and salt into a bowl from a height to get air mixed in.
Make a well. Add the eggs and begin to add milk slowly stirring all the time. When half the milk has been added stir in the oil and beat well until smooth. Add the rest of the milk and mix well. Cover and let stand 30 minute or longer (most of the day) to allow the mix to settle and the flour to absorb moisture.

The batter should be runny, of pouring consistency, like thin cream.

Heat a frying pan, melt a knob of butter. Drop a little batter in to test the temperature – it should sizzle and brown quickly. Ladle in just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry one side for approx ½ - 1 minute until golden brown when you lift the edge, loosen all round, and bravely flip the pancake. Cook the other side briefly.

Best eaten immediately, but they could be stacked in a warm oven, separated by sheets of greaseproof paper.

Tradition requires that these pancakes be served with caster sugar and lemon juice, and only once a year on Pancake Tuesday.

They freeze well.
