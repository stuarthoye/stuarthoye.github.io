            <p>
                Plotto is an algorithm for generating plots for pulp novels
                created by William Wallace Cook in 1928.<br/>I would like to
                automate the algorithm even further.

            <p>
                The Edmonton Bicycle Commuters Society used to run a program that
                let users access bicycles for free.<br/>  I would like to write
                an application for smart phones that allows users to sign out
                bicycles, and tracks where they ride them while they're being
                borrowed. <br/><br/>Think of Pogo, but greener and cheaper.

            <p>
                You know that Yelp is overrated.<br/>All you want to do is let 
                your good pal know the new falafel house is tip-top, but you 
                also want to keep this cherished eatery a well-guarded secret.<br/>
                Maybe service was slow and rude at your fave drive-in diner, or
                the milkshake you got was not shaken - it was stirred.<br/><br/>
                Don't blow your top: just Muttr at your buddy.

            <p>
                I currently live with a 70-year-old and a 91-year-old.  They're
                not too confident with how to use their computers, so I help
                them out.<br/>I explain things like how to save your work in 
                Microsoft Word, or how to make posts on Facebook.<br/>I'm patient
                and understanding, and I know that it can feel overwhelming to 
                keep up with the breakneck pace of it all.<br/>If you're feeling
                swept away on the digital tide, I'd be happy to help you out, too.
                <br/><br/>Ding-ding!  Help A-Hoye!
